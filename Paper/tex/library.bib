Hypothesis: if niche differentiation reduces competition for soil nitrogen, its signature should be evident in patterns of species dominance (productivity). Dominant species should use the most available forms of soild nitrogen and subordinate species less available forms.}

Once density reaches Ns or above, predators take only prey, no alternative food.

annote = {Hairston et al (2005) previously showed that, given an ecologically relevant response variable, X, evolving trait z, and environmental variable k, the following relationship holds: dX/dt = dX/dz*dz/dt + dX/dk*dk/dt where dX/dz and dX/dk describe the relative contributions of trait(s) z and env var(s) k. This approach fails to account for the fact that not all change in trait(s) z are necessarily evolutionary in origin. Much trait change occurs as the result of non-heritable factors. This paper expands on Hairston et al (2005) to account for phenotypic plasticity, and changes in age/size structure of the population. Here, Elner et al show that we can decompose the dz/dt term further, by the following relation: dz/dt = Cov(m,z) + E[$\Delta$z] where m-sub i represents the fitness of individuals of genotype i, and z-sub i is the mean trait value of individuals with genotype i. Cov(m,z) describes the change in the trait mean which is due to changes in genotype frequencies, i.e. evolution. Why precisely this is the case is not intuitive to me, but the math from eq 2 - 6 is easy enough to follow, and it makes sense that when the fitness of a trait and it's value are tightly correlated, one would expect a more rapid change in trait value over time than if they were only weakly correlated. The E[$\Delta$z] term describes changes in z (the trait mean) that are due to a change in the trait mean of a particular genotype. The meaning of this term is a little less clear than for the covariance term. It could represent phenotypic plasticity in response to a shift in the environmental variable, k, it could be the result of (st)age structure in the populations, or it could be imposed by outside forces not considered, such as disase (in this way it seems to me that it's just a term that collects all of the trait change that isn't attributable to changes in genotypes, or changes in the measured envionrmental varaibles). They then show that by substituting this decomposition in for dz/dt (eqn 5), and then replacing Cov(m,z) by dz/dt - E[$\Delta$z] (eqn 6), we can obtain an expression (eqn 6) for trait change over time, which describes the proportional effects of evolution and ecology on trait change, without actually having to measure the effect of evolution at all (and simply obtaining it by subtraction). Alternatively, we could use an actual mechanistic (population genetic?) model of selection to obtain the value of Cov(m,z)}
