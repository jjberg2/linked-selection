Dear Editor,
            Please find enclosed our paper XXXXXX.

As you know there is currently a lot of interest in understanding, both empirically and theoretically, an expanded range of different models of sweeps, including sweeps from multiple mutations and standing variation. Here we study patterns of variation after a sweep from standing variation, where the beneficial mutation, arose once, and was at a low frequency before selection pressures changed and it swept. We assume that before the allele swept it was either neutral or had been maintained at this low frequency by balancing selection. 


In this paper we develop a simple, but accurate approximation to the genealogy in the region surrounding a sweep from standing variation. Our approximation is based om the idea that the haplotypes the selection allele is present on, at the moment that selection pressures change, can be well modeled by an application of the Ewens sampling formula. Using this approximation we derived a range of summaries of polmorphism data including pairwise diversity, the number of segregating sites, and the frequency spectrum. We discuss how our approximation gives insight into the haplotype frequency spectrum as we move away from the selected site. 

Joachim Hermisson, Wolfgang Stephan, or Rasmus Nielsen would be suitable editors.
