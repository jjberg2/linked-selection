\section{Introduction}

In recent decades, an understanding of how positive directional selection and the associated hitchhiking effect influence patterns of genetic variation has become a valuable tool for evolutionary geneticists. The reductions in genetic diversity and long extended haplotypes that are characteristic of a recent selective sweep can allow for both the identification of individual genes that have contributed to recent adaptation within a population (i.e. hitchhiking mapping), and for understanding the rate and dynamics of adaptation at a genome-wide level \citep{Wiehe:1993th,Andolfatto:2007cq,EyreWalker:2009fq,Elyashiv:2014uc} \jb{more}.

While the contribution of many different modes to the adaptive process has long been recognized \jb{REFS}, early work on the hitchhiking effect focused largely on the scenario where a single co-dominant mutation arose and was immediately beneficial, rapidly sweeping to fixation \citep{Smith1974,Kaplan1989}. Both simulation studies and analytical explorations during the last decade however have drawn attention to alternate sweep model in which multiple independent copies of the beneficial allele may be present in the standing variation or arise from recurrent mutation before the sweep has completed \citep{Innan:2004bk,Przeworski2005,Hermisson2005,Pennings2006a,Pennings2006,Hermisson2008,BARRETT:2008cs,Ralph2010,Pokalyuk2012,Roesti:2014gp,Wilson:2014ke}. Collectively, these phenomena have come to be known as ``soft sweeps'', a term originally coined by \cite{Hermisson2005}, and now often used to refer to any sweep for which the most recent common ancestor at the locus of the beneficial allele(s) predates the onset of positive selection \citep{Messer:2013kh}.

Empirical work occurring largely in parallel with the theory discussed above suggests that soft sweeps of one variety or another likely make a substantial contribution to adaptation. For example, many freshwater stickleback populations have independently lost the bony plating of their marine ancestors due to repeated selection on an ancient standing variant at the \textit{Eda} gene \citep{Colosimo:2005ee}, and a substantial fraction of the increased apical dominance in maize relative to teosinte can be traced to a standing variant which predates domestication by at least 10,000 years \citep{Studer:2011bya}. Additional examples of adaptation from standing variation have been documented in \textit{Drosophila} \citep{Magwire:2011eq}, \textit{Peromyscus} \citep{Domingues:2012kw} and humans \citep{Peter:2012ht}, among others. Adaptations involving simultaneous selection on multiple alleles of independent origin at the same locus have also been documented across a wide array of species \citep{Menozzi:2004iu,Nair2007,Karasov:2010ij,Salgueiro:2010hx,Schmidt:2010bu,Jones:2013iw}. Nonetheless, the general importance of soft sweeps for the adaptive process remains somewhat contentious \citep[see e.g.][]{Jensen:2014hd}.

While models of the hitchhiking effect under soft sweeps involving multiple independent mutations have received a fair amount of analytical attention \citep{Pennings2006a,Pennings2006,Hermisson2008,Pokalyuk2012,Wilson:2014ke}, the model of a single origin mutation which segregates as a standing variant before sweeping in response to an environmental change is less well characterized. Present understanding of the hitchhiking effect in a single population under this model comes primarily from two sources. The first is a pair of simulation studies \citep{Innan:2004bk,Przeworski2005}, which focused largely on simple summaries of diversity and the allele frequency spectrum, and the second is the general verbal intuition that, similar to the multiple mutation case, the beneficial allele should be found on ``multiple haplotypes''. In contrast to the multiple mutation case, these additional haplotypes are created as a result of recombination events during the period before the sweep when the allele was present in the standing variation, rather than due to recurrent mutations on different ancestral haplotypes \citep{BARRETT:2008cs,Messer:2013kh}.

In this paper, we present an analytical treatment of this model in which an allele with a single mutational origin segregates at low frequency (either neutrally or under the influence of balancing selection with asymmetric heterozygote advantage) and then sweeps to fixation after a change in the environment. The central observation is that, with some simplifying assumptions, the recombination events which are responsible for the multiple haplotypes on which the beneficial allele is found have a close analogy to mutations in the infinite alleles model, and we can therefore leverage the Ewens Sampling Formula to obtain an analytical description for the genealogical history of a neutral locus linked to the beneficial allele. We then show that this model can be used to obtain a highly accurate approximation for the expected deviation in the frequency spectrum at a given genetic distance, as well as to shed light on how the expected pattern of haplotype structure differ between the multiple recurrent mutation and sweep from standing  variation cases. We conclude with a brief simulation study examining the order statistics of the haplotype frequency spectrum under the classic hard sweep, multiple mutation soft sweep, and standing sweep models, with the aim of demonstrating how future methods to identify and classify sweeps can best make use of this information.
 
%
%In a subsequent pair of papers also under the ``soft sweeps'' banner, they focused on a slightly different scenario, in which new mutations arising once a selective sweep had already begun managed to increase in frequency quickly enough to make a substantial contribution to a class of beneficial alleles before the first sweeping mutation has managed to fix. In the usage of Pennings and Hermisson, these sweeps are ``soft'', in that they include contributions from multiple independent mutations, even though they do not come from the standing variation.
%
%Some authors, by contrast, have used a looser definition of soft sweep \jb{will have to track down citations for this; recent X v. autosome preprint about human/chimp speciation from Mailund and friends is one example}. In contrast to the definition proffered by Pennings and Hermisson, under this usage a soft sweep is generally ``a selective sweep in which the beneficial mutation is present on more than one \gc{common} haplotype'', irrespective of the histories of the beneficial mutations on those haplotypes. Under this definition, an adaptive fixation with only a single mutational origin may be considered a ``soft sweep'' if it was present as standing variation in the population before \gc{the environmental shift, e.g. if it was neutral or balanced at low frequency. In that case the allele can be been recombining on to different haplotype in the population for some time,} before a change in the environment caused it to become beneficial, at which point \gc{multiple} haplotypes onto which the beneficial mutation has recombined collectively sweep to \gc{intermediate frequencies}.
%
%\gc{
%The role of soft sweeps is shaping genome-wide patterns of variation has been debated contenious \citep{Dmitripreprint, Dmitrireive, Jensen, Pritchard, Hernandez}, and touches on a number of important questions, e.g. the extent to which adaptation is mutation-limited. However, while the term soft sweep is catchy it is likely also (likely) unhelpfully broad and may lead to confusion \gc{(and we have likely been guilty of adding to this ourselves)}. While a variety of models lead to violations of the simple sweep pattern, they do not leave identical patterns and differ strongly in the decay of their signal as we move away from the selected site (as we discuss below). We think it best to be more specific and call these different models a ``sweep from multiple mutations'' or a ``sweep from a single standing variant''. In practice it can be hard to distinguish these various kinds of sweeps, and often hard to distinguish them from hard sweeps, but it is a useful distinction to make. }
%
%Further confusing the situation, selection on recessive alleles can also lead to 
%
%
%\jb{this transition is really clunky and needs to be fleshed out more}
%
%\gc{The model of a ``sweep from a single standing variant'' has} been studied via simulation by previous authors such as \cite{Innan:2004bk} and \cite{Przeworski2005}, but to our knowledge there have been no detailed analytical investigations of the hitchhiking process of a single identical by descent mutation that sweeps after first drifting to appreciable frequency. It is this model that is the primary focus of this paper. We first develop a coalescent based approximation to describe the genealogical history of a sample taken at a locus where a beneficial allele that was previously drifting neutrally has just fixed in the population. We then consider a second neutral locus linked to this selected locus and show that a form of the Ewens Sampling Formula can be used in order to understand the hitchhiking effect at this locus, and thus to describe the expected patterns of genetic diversity surrounding a selective sweep from standing variation. Although an explicit, formal description of the haplotype frequency spectrum surrounding a sweep from standing variation is beyond our mathematical means, we show that our model can be used to gain considerable intuition into which features of it are informative, and to guide future efforts to develop inference techniques that can identify sweeps from standing variation as well as distinguish among different varieties. Lastly, although our model is primarily motivated by the case of a neutral or balanced polymorphism that eventually becomes beneficial and sweeps, we show that our model also provides an adequate description of the hitchhiking signature of a completely recessive sweep (either \textit{de novo} or from standing variation \jb{obv need to explore this more, but have a hunch that recessive mutation that was previously at mut-sel balance will be fit well by our model}), for reasons that are relatively easy to explain \jb{note: explain them}.
%
\section{Model}

%\subsection{more technical}

We consider two linked loci separated on the chromosome by a recombination distance $r$. At one of these loci a new allele, B, arises in a background of ancestral b alleles. This allele segregates at low frequency for some period of time (either due to neutral fluctuations, or because it is a balanced polymorphism), before a change in the environment causes it to become beneficial and sweep to fixation. Our aim is to describe some features of the genealogy at the second, neutral locus, and to use this understanding to build intuition regarding the process of a sweep from standing variation, as well as to derive the patterns of DNA sequence variation we expect to observe near a recently completed sweep from standing variation.

Our general approach is to break the history of the standing sweep into two periods, the first being the time during which the B allele is selectively favored and rising in frequency (we refer to this as the sweep phase), and the second being the period after the mutation has arisen but before the environmental shift causes it to become beneficial (we refer to this as the standing phase). We assume that the frequency trajectory of the allele is logistic during the sweep phase, and that selection is sufficiently strong relative to the sample size such that only recombination (i.e. no coalescence) occurs during this phase. We approximate the standing phase by assuming that the frequency of the B allele is held at some constant value $f$ infinitely far into the past prior to the onset of selection. While this is obviously a coarse approximation to the true history of a low frequency allele, it is nonetheless accurate enough for our purposes, and enjoys some theoretical justification, as we discuss below. The key advantage to using this approximation is that it allows us to model the genealogy of the B alleles as a standard neutral coalescent (rescaled by a factor $f$), and therefore to treat recombination events moving away from the selected locus in a manor analogous to mutations in the infinite alleles model. This allows us to use a version of the Ewens Sampling Formula to calculate a number of summaries of sequence diversity, and to build intuition for how patterns of haplotype diversity should change in regions surrounding a standing sweep.

%\jb{In this paper, we will use the phrase `beneficial allele' to refer to the allele that becomes beneficial during the selected phase and the phrase `non-beneficial allele' to refer to the complementary allele which becomes disfavored, regardless of whether the effect of selection is actually being felt during the part of the process being considered. We will use the phrase `sweep phase' to refer to the part of the history during which the beneficial allele is increasing in frequency due to positive selection, and the phrase `standing phase' to refer to the part of the history that preceeds the onset of selection.}

\section{Results}

\subsubsection{Sweep Phase}

Looking backward in time, let $X\left(t\right)$ be the frequency of the B allele at time $t$ in the past, where $t=0$ is the moment of fixation (i.e. $X\left(0\right) = 1; X\left(t\right) < 1\ \forall\ t > 0$). If we consider a neutral locus a genetic distance $r$ away from the beneficial allele, the probability that  fails to recombine off of the selected background in generation $t$ given that it has not done so already is $1-r\left(1-X(t)\right)$. If we let $\tau_{f}$ be the generation in which the environmental change occurred, marking the boundary between the sweep phase and the standing phase (i.e. $X\left(\tau_{f}\right) = f$), then the probability that a single lineage fails to recombine off the selected background at any point during the course of the sweep phase is given by
\begin{equation}
P_{NR} = \prod_{t=0}^{\tau_{f}} 1-r\left(1-X(t)\right)  \approx \exp \left(-r \int_0^{\tau_{f}}(1-X\left(t\right))\mathrm{d} t \right)
\end{equation}
for $r \ll 1$. We set  $\mathcal{T}_{\left(s,f\right)} = \int_0^{\tau_{f}}(1-X\left(t\right))\mathrm{d}t$, so that the probability that a lineage manages to recombine off the selected background during the course of the sweep from frequency $f$ can be written simply as $e^{-r\mathcal{T}_{\left(s,f\right)}}$. If the effect of our beneficial allele on relative fitness is strictly additive, such that heterozygotes enjoy a selective advantage of $s/2$ and homozygotes an advantage of $s$, then the trajectory of the beneficial allele through the population can be approximated deterministically by the logistic function, such that 
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{T}_{\left(s,f\right)} = \frac{ln\left(\frac{N_e - 1}{f}-N_e + 1\right)}{s}.
\end{equation}

We assume that the sweep occurs fast enough that the probability of coalescence during the sweep is essentially zero. Therefore, each lineage either recombines off the beneficial background, or fails to do so, independently of all other lineages. The probability that $i$ out of $n$ lineages fail to escape off the sweeping background is then
\begin{equation}
P_{NR}(i \mid n) = {n \choose i} P_{NR}^{i} (1-P_{NR})^{n-i}.
\end{equation}
This binomial approximation has been made by a number of authors in the context of hard sweeps \citep{Smith1974,Barton1998,Fay:2000us,McVean:2006ke}, for which more accurate approximations have now been developed \citep{Durrett:2004fl,Durrett:2005fr,Etheridge:2006fk,Messer:2012ie}. Because the earliest phases of a hard sweep, where most of the coalescence occurs, are replaced in our model by the standing phase described below, this binomial approximation is better justified in our case than in most. However, as we demonstrate with simulations later on, even with strong selection and modest sample sizes the probability of a small number of coalescent events during the sweep phase is in fact non-negligible, and so more accurate approximations to this phase would be welcome \jb{maybe this stuff goes to end?}.


\subsubsection{Standing Phase}
Looking backward in time, having originally sampled $n$ lineages at $t=0$, we arrive at the beginning of the standing phase at time $\tau_{f}$ with $i$ lineages still linked to the beneficial background, the other $n-i$ having recombined into the non-beneficial background during the sweep.

We will argue that an understanding of patterns of diversity at the neutral locus following a standing sweep can be obtained principally by tracking the histories of only the lineages that are found on the \textbf{B} background at the beginning of the standing phase, and assuming that lineages which recombine off of the \textbf{B} background do not re-enter it. This is obviously a coarse approximation to the true process, but as we argue below, it captures many of the major features sufficiently well for our purposes.

% The following paragraphs are therefore structured as follows: first, we describe an approximation to the coalescent process for \textbf{B} alleles at the \fancyB locus conditional on being at a frequency $f$ at the beginning of the standing phase. Next, we describe an approximation to the process of recombination events which move alleles at the \fancyN locus from the beneficial background onto the non-beneficial background at the \fancyB locus. Finally, we combine these two processes along with the recombination process during the sweep phase and a separation of timescales argument to give an approximate description of the full genealogy at the \fancyN locus.

\paragraph{The Coalescent Process of the B Alleles}

%In attempting to construct the genealogy of the B alleles backward in time, consider that in the first generation of the standing phase, the probability that any pair of B coalesces with one another is $1/\left(2Nf\right)$, while the probability that any pair of b alleles coalesce with one another is $1/\left(2N\left(1-f\right)\right)$. In general, the pairwise coalescent probabilities for pairs of lineages $T$ generations back into the standing phase are $1/\left(2NX(\tau_{f} + T)\right)$ for the B alleles, and $1/\left(2N\left(1-X\left(\tau_{f}+T\right)\right)\right)$ for the b alleles, where the frequency $X\left(\tau_{f} + T\right)$ may be equal to, greater than, or less than $f$, due to the random sampling effects of genetic drift. Further, coalescent events which may have occurred during the intervening $T$ generations contain information about the distribution of $X\left(\tau_{f} + T\right)$.

A number of previous studies have examined the behavior of this process \citep{Wiuf1999,Wiuf:2000js,Patterson2005}, either conditional on the frequency of the allele in a sample or in the population. \cite{Wiuf:2000js} has shown that the expected time to the first coalescent event is $2 N f/ {i \choose 2}$ in the absence of other information, e.g. as to whether the allele is ancestral or derived. However, the distribution of coalescence times is no longer exponential. The variance of the time between coalescent events is increased relative to the exponential as a direct result of the fact that the frequency may increase or decrease from $f$ before a given coalescent event is reached. Further, in contrast to the standard coalescent, there is non-zero covariance between subsequent coalescent intervals, as a result of the information they contain about how the frequency of the allele has changed, and thus about the rate at which subsequent coalescent events occur. Lastly, if the allele is known to be either derived or ancestral, the coalescent times have a more complicated expectation, as the allele is in expectation either decreasing or increasing in frequency backward in time due to the conditioning on derived or ancestral status respectively.

Despite these complications, we have found that assuming that all pairs of lineages coalesce at a constant rate $1/(2 N f)$ and that coalescent time intervals are independent, in other words, that the allele frequency does not drift from $f$, is not a bad approximation when $f \ll 1$, even when we condition on the allele being derived \jb{Supp. Figures XXX-XXX}

The main reason for using this approximation is that, in conjunction with a separation of timescales (i.e. an assumption that no \textbf{b} alleles coalesce until after all lineages have exited the \textbf{B} background), it allows us to work with a simple, well understood caricature of the true process (i.e. the neutral coalescent) that still describes the genealogy at the selected site with reasonable accuracy. Given this simplified coalescent process, we can study the recombination events occurring between the beneficial and neutral loci to understand the properties of the genetic variation at the neutral locus that will hitchhike along with the \textbf{B} allele once the sweep phase begins.

\paragraph{Recombination Events Ocurring During the Standing Phase}

We will again rely on the condition that $f \ll 1$, and assume that any lineage at the neutral locus that recombines off of the background of our beneficial allele will not recombine back into that background before it is removed by mutation. Under these assumptions, recombination events which move lineages at the neutral locus from the \textbf{B} background onto the \textbf{b} background can be viewed simply as events on the genealogy at the beneficial locus which occur at rate $r\left(1-f\right)$ for each lineage independently. Rescaling time by $2Nf$, an understanding of the genealogy at the neutral locus can therefore be found by considering the competing poisson processes of coalescence at rate $1$ per pair of lineages, and recombination at rate $2Nrf(1-f)$ per lineage.

We are interested in the number and size of different recombinant clades at a given genetic distance from the selected site (colored clades in Figure \ref{cartoon_fig_1}B \& C). Under our approximate model for the history of coalescence and recombination at these sites, this a direct analogy of the infinite alleles model \citep{}. In the normal infinite alleles process, we imagine simulating from the coalescent, scattering mutations down on the genealogy, and then assigning each lineage to be of a type corresponding to the mutation that sits lowest above it in the genealogy. Alternately, we can create a sample from the infinite alleles model by simulating the mutational and coalescent processes simultaneously: coalescing lineages together as we go move backward in time, ``killing'' lineages whenever they first encounter a mutation and assigning all tips sitting below the mutation to be of the same allelic type (see Figure \ref{cartoon_fig_1}C) \jb{cite for coalescent with killings}.

Given the direct analogy to the infinite alleles model under our set of approximations, the number and frequency of the various recombinant lineage classes at a given distance from the selected site can be found using the Ewens Sampling Formula \citep{Ewens1972}. The population-scaled mutation rate in the infinitely-many alleles model ($\theta/2=2N\mu$), is replaced in our model by the rate of recombination out of the selected class ($R_{f}/2=2Nrf(1-f)$). If $i$ lineages sampled at the moment of fixation fail to recombine off of the beneficial background during the course of the sweep, then the probability that these $i$ lineages coalesce into a set of $k$ recombinant lineages is 
\begin{equation}
	p_{ESF}(k \mid R_f,n)  = S(i,k) \frac{R_f^k}{ \prod_{\ell=1}^{i-1} (R_f +\ell) }  \label{ESF1}
\end{equation}
where $S(i,k)$ is an unsigned Stirling number of the first kind
\begin{equation}
	S(i,k) = \sum_{i_1 + \dots + i_k = i} \frac{i!}{k!i_1\dots i_k}
\end{equation}
These recombinant lineages partition our sample up between themselves, such that each lineage has some number of descendants in our present day sample $\{i_1,i_2,\dots,i_k\}$, where $\sum_{j=1}^k i_j =i$. Conditional on $k$, the probability of a given sample configuration is
\begin{equation}
	p(\{i_1,i_2,\dots,i_k\} \mid k,i) = \frac{i!}{k! i_1\cdots i_k S(i,k)}  \label{ESF2}
\end{equation}
Note that this does not depend on $R_f$, which gives the classic result that the number of alleles is sufficient statistic for $R_f$ (i.e. the partition is not needed to estimate $R_f$).

The dotted lines give our approximation under the Ewens Sampling Formula (eqn \eqref{ESF1}) with $R_f=4Nrf(1-f)$. } \label{Prob_hap_distribution}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection*{Patterns of neutral diversity surrounding standing sweeps}
This approximate model of the coalescent for a sweep from standing variation allows us to calculate a number of basic summaries of sequence variation in the region surrounding the sweep. For now we neglect mutations which occur over the time-scale of our shrunken coalescent tree, and assume that all diversity comes from mutations that occurred prior to the sweep, or equivalently that this part of the genealogy contributes negligibly to the total amount of time in the genealogy. This corresponds to an assumption that $2N \mu f \ll 2N\mu$, in line with our previous assumption that $f \ll 1$ (see the appendix for a partial relaxation of this assumption). So long as this assumption holds, we can consider patterns of diversity in our sample at a given site simply by considering properties of the recombinant lineages in our sample, which correspond to alleles drawn independently from a neutral population prior to the start of our sweep.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{../Paper_Figures/pi_and_S_density.pdf} \label{pi_plot}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{$\pi$ and S} We first take interest in determining the expected total time in the genealogy, at a given distance from the selected site, which allows us to obtain approximations for simple summary statistics such as the pairwise diversity and expected number of segregating sites. Conditional on $m$ independent lineages escaping the sweep, the expected total time in the genealogy is $2N \sum_{j=1}^{m-1} 1/j$, the standard result for a neutral coalescent with $m$ lineages \citep{Watterson:1975ur}. For a moment conditioning on no recombination during the sweep phase, the probability that $k$ independent lineages escape during the standing phase, given that there are at least 2 (otherwise all coalescence occurs on the $\textbf{B}$ background and $T_{TOT} \approx 0$) is 
\begin{equation}
	p_{ESF}\left(k \mid R_f , n , k > 1\right) = \frac{p_{ESF}\left(k \mid R_f , n \right)}{1 - p_{ESF}\left(1 \mid R_f , n \right)}
\end{equation}
Conditional on no recombination during the sweep phase, the expected time in the genealogy is
\begin{equation}
	\mathbb{E}\left(T_{TOT} \mid i = n \right)  \approx 2N \sum_{k=2}^n p_{ESF}(k\mid R_f,n, k>1)   \sum_{j=1}^{k+n-i-1} 1/j.
\end{equation}

Allowing for all possible numbers of singleton recombinants during the sweep phase, the expected total time in the genealogy is
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\mathbb{E}(T_{TOT})  	&\approx 2N \biggl( P_{NR}(i=n\mid  n)  \sum_{k=2}^n p_{ESF}(k\mid R_f,n , k > 1)   \sum_{j=1}^{k+n-i-1} 1/j \\
							&+ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} P_{NR} ( i \mid n) \sum_{k=0}^i p_{ESF}(k\mid R_f,n)   \sum_{j=1}^{k+n-i-1} 1/j\biggr)
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
(note that we have taken $p_{ESF}\left(0 \mid R_f,0\right)=1$, and $p_{ESF}\left(0 \mid R_f,i\right)=0\ \forall\ i > 0$; whereas it is typically impossible to obtain a sample with zero alleles, in our case we must define these probabilities to accommodate the case in which all $n$ lineages recombine out during the sweep phase)
and the expected number of segregating sites can be found by multiplying this quantity by the mutation rate. For a sample of $n = 2$, this expression simplifies considerably, and we can obtain a simple expression for the expected reduction in pairwise diversity relative to the neutral expectation as
\begin{equation}
	\mathbb{E}\left(\frac{\pi_R}{\pi_0}\right) \approx \left(1-\frac{1}{1 + R_f} P_{NR}^2  \right).
\end{equation}

\paragraph{The Frequency Spectrum} We can also use our approximation to obtain an expression for the full frequency spectrum at sites surrounding a sweep from standing variation. To break the problem into approachable components, we first consider the frequency spectrum of an allele that is polymorphic within the set of lineages which do not recombine during the sweep (ignoring it's frequency in the sweep phase recominants), and we condition on a fixed number $k$ recombinant families from the standing phase. Borrowing from \cite{Pennings2006} (equation 14 of their paper), if we condition on $j$ out of these $k$ recombinant lineages carrying a derived allele, then we can obtain the probability that $l$ of the $i$ sampled lineages carry the derived allele by summing over all possible partitions of the $i$ lineages into $k$ families such that the $j$ recombinant ancestors carrying the derived mutation have exactly $l$ descendants in the present day
\begin{equation}
p(l \mid j, ~k,~i) = \sum_{\substack{i_1+\cdots +i_j=l \\i_{j+1}+\cdots + i_k=n-l}} p(\{i_1,\dots,i_k\} \mid k, n) = \frac{ {n \choose l} }{ {k \choose j} }\frac{ S(l,j)  S(n-l,k-j)  }{ S(n,k) } \label{ESF_gives_freq_spec}
\end{equation}

Next, we write $q\left(j \mid k\right)$ to denote the probability that $j$ out of the $k$ recombinant families carry the derived mutation. For our purposes, we will assume this distribution follows that of the standard neutral coalescent expectation (i.e. $q(j \mid k) = \frac{1/j}{\sum_{\ell=1}^{k-1}1/\ell}$ gives the probability of $j$ derived alleles in a sample of $k$, conditional on segregation), although an empirical frequency spectrum measured from genome-wide data, as in \cite{Nielsen:2005bla}, could also be used. The probability that the derived allele is present in $l$ out of $i$ sampled lineages, conditional on there having been $k$ recombinant families, is then 
\begin{equation}
	p(l \mid k, i ) = \sum_{j=1}^k p(l \mid j,~k, ~i)q(j\mid k).
\end{equation}	
Summing over the distribution of $k$ given by \eqref{ESF1}, we obtain an expression for the frequency spectrum conditional on segregation within the set of $i$ lineages which do not recombine during the sweep as
\begin{equation}
	p(l \mid i) =  \sum_{k=2}^{n}  p_{ESF}(k \mid R_f,i,k>1)  \sum_{j=1}^{k-1} q(j\mid k) p(l \mid j,~k, ~i)
\end{equation}
This approximation is highly accurate for loci that are distant from the focal site, but breaks down for loci that are tightly linked. The reason for this is that very near the focal site, it is actually very unlikely that there have been any recombination events at all, and so while polymorphism is rare, when it is present it is likely to have arisen due to new mutations on the genealogy of the $\textbf{B}$ allele, rather than ancestrally. While an exact accounting for the contribution of new mutations is beyond our scope, in the appendix we present an \textit{ad hoc} calculation to include the contribution of new mutations, and present this improved approximation in Figure \ref{freq_spec}.

When we allow for recombination during the sweep, the expression becomes more complex, as we must take into account the fact a mutation may be polymorphic after the sweep even if it is either absent or fixed in the set of lineages which hitchhike. Nonetheless, we obtain an expression for the frequency spectrum of ancestral polymorphism as
\begin{equation}
		p(l \mid n ) = \sum_{i=0}^n P_{NR}(i\mid  n) \sum_{k=1}^{i} p_{ESF}(k \mid R_f,n-i) \sum_{j=1}^{\text{min}\left(k+n-i-1,\ell\right)} q(j\mid k+n-i) \sum_{g = \text{max} \left( j - k , 0 \right) }^{\text{min} \left( j , \ell , \left(n-i\right) \right)} H(g \mid j,k,n-i) p(\ell-g \mid j-g,k,i) \label{rearrange-anc-freq-spec}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	H(g \mid j,k,n-i) = \frac{{n-i \choose g}{k \choose j - g}}{{k + n - i \choose j}}
\end{equation}
gives the probability that $g$ out of a total of $j$ derived alleles which existed before the sweep are found on singleton recombinants created during the sweep, given that there are $n-i$ singletons, and $k$ recombinant families created during the standing phase. 

In words, $n-i$ lineages recombine out during the selected phase, while the remaining $i$ lineages are partitioned into $k$ families due to recombination and coalescence in the standing phase. Out of the $n-i$ singleton lineages, $g$ of them carry the derived allele, while the remaining $j-g$ copies of the derived allele give rise to $l-g$ derived alleles due to coalescence during the standing phase, resulting in a final frequency of  $\frac{l}{n}$ in the present day sample. \jb{is this paragraph necessary?}

Once again, this expression is accurate far from the selected site, but in error at closely linked sites due to the contribution of new mutations. Again, we can develop an $\textit{ad hoc}$ approximation to incorporate new mutations (\jb{appendix ref} and Figure \ref{freq_spec}), but the approximation is not quite as good as for the no sweep approximation\jb{...}. In Figure \ref{freq_spec}, we show a comparison of simulations done in \textit{ms} with the improved approximation in the appendix.

\subsection{Patterns of Haplotypic variation in sweep models}

%\jb{Write some nice intro here}
%Consider the task of both detecting and distinguishing selective sweeps of the classical ``hard'', standing, and multiple hit ``soft'' cases. A large number of methods now exist for detecting classic hard sweeps \jb{refs}, and a few approaches designed specifically for soft sweeps have been developed as well \jb{cite Nandita and Ben here}.
%
%We consider the problem of doing inference on sweep parameters (where the ``type'' of sweep is included as a ``parameter'') in a hypothetical situation in which we have access to the maximal amount of information which could reasonably be obtained directly from sequence data. In other words, we imagine an ``infinite haplotypes'' model, in which all chromosomes sampled at the completion of the sweep can be assigned to a unique ancestral chromosome which existed immediately prior to the beginning of the sweep. 

We continue with our infinitely-many haplotypes perspective, in which we imagine that every piece of DNA present in the sample taken at fixation can be labelled/colored according to which chromosome in the ancestral, pre-sweep population it traces its ancestry to. Under this convention, right at the selected site, all chromosomes descending from either a hard sweep or a standing sweep will be of the same ``color'', due to their shared common ancestry, while for multiple mutation soft sweeps each set of chromosomes tracing to a different mutational origin of the beneficial allele will be of a different color. For all kinds of sweeps, the number of distinctly colored haplotypes increases with distance from the selected site due to recombination events which cause transitions along the sequence in the haplotype partition scheme.

Unfortunately, explicit analytical expressions for these haplotype partition transitions are unavailable under any sweep model, and ours is no exception. Nonetheless, we gain some insight from a simple description of the process, and this descriptions motivates some further simulations.

Recall that $\tau_{f}$, the duration of the sweep, is of order $1/s$, while the time from the beginning of the standing phase back to the common ancestor of the beneficial alleles is approximately $4N_e f$. Therefore, if $4N_e s f \ll 1$ (i.e. selection is weak, or the mutation is still quite rare when selection switches on), recombination events during the sweep phase erase any signal of the fact that the allele was previously standing, and the eventual pattern is very similar to that of a hard sweep.

The alternate extreme of $4N_e s f \gg 1$ occurs when selection is strong or the mutation was segregating at a relatively high frequency prior to the onset of selection. In this parameter regime, the sweep phase occurs fast enough that recombination events from this period tend to be far away from the selected site, and the structure of the haplotype partition is dominated by events in the standing phase. Below, we consider constructing the haplotype partition as a process along the sequence in the limit $4N_e s f \rightarrow \infty$, ignoring the sweep phase. 

If the total time in the coalescent tree in the neutral phase at the selected site is $T_{tot}$, then the distance to the first recombination is $\sim \exp \left( r_{BP} T_{tot} \right)$. Using the standard approximation to the constant in Watterson's $\theta$, the expected length scale over which a single haplotype should persist away from the selected site is $\approx 1/( 2 N_e r_{BP}f\left(1-f\right) log(n-1))$ (and twice this distance if we consider both sides of the sweep). This recombination partions the haplotypes according to the infinite alleles model for single mutation placed at random on the geneaology at the selected site (e.g. the green recombinant moving to the left in Figure \ref{cartoon_3_kinds}C). Moving down the sequence we then generate the next distance to a recombination, again from $\sim \exp \left( r_{BP} T_{tot} \right)$. We again uniformly simulate a position on the tree for this new recombination, however, this time only a recombination on some of the branches would result in a new haplotype being introduced into the sample. If the recombination falls in a place that doesn't alter the configuration we ignore it and simulate another distance from this new position. Otherwise, we keep the recombination event and split the sample configuration again. For example, the red recombinant in Figure \ref{cartoon_3_kinds}C does not alter the sample configuration and so can be ignored. While it does recombine the selected allele off of its original black haplotype, this recombinant is not visible in our contemporary sample (likewise the light blue recombinant in Figure 1XX is not visible). We iterate this procedure moving away from the selected site, generating exponential distances to the next recombination, placing the recombination down, updating the configuration if needed, until we reach the point that every colored haplotype is a singleton. We then repeat this procedure on the other side of the selected site using the same underlying genealogy.

An equivalent way to describe this process is to simulate distances to the next recombination that alters the configuration, given the tree and the previous recombinations. To do this we consider the total time in the tree where a recombination would alter the configuration. Numbering these recombinations out from the selected site,  we start at the selected site $i=0$, with $T_0 = T_{tot}$ and generate a distance to the first recombination $\sim \exp(r_{BP} T_0)$. We place the recombination on the tree, then prune the tree of branches where no further change in sample configuration could result in a new colored haplotype. We then set $T_i$ to the total time in these pruned subtrees, place the next recombination uniformly on the pruned branches at an $\sim \exp(r_{BP} T_0)$ distance and carry on this process till we have pruned the entire tree (at which point the distance to the next visible recombination would be infinite as we are left only with singleton haplotypes). 

As discussed above, marginally at a given site the partitioning of haplotypes (integrating out the unobserved genealogy) is given by the ESF. It is unclear to us how to couple together the partitioning at two sites in an analytically tractable way, e.g. how to calculate the probability that the sample configuration is $\{i_1,i_2,\dots,i_k\}$ at a distance $r_1$ and is $\{i_1,i_2,\dots,i_k,\dots,i_{k+j}\}$ for $j>0$ at a further distance $r_2$. Obviously this can be calculated numerically for small samples by resorting to brute force integration over the set of all unobserved trees that are consistent with the partition at the first site, but it seems like a more elegant solution may be possible. Given the general interest in the ESF motivated by exchangeable partitions and clustering algorithms, such a coupling may be of wider interest.
 
\subsubsection*{Observed haplotype frequency spectum}
To this point, our discussions of haplotype variation have focused on haplotypes defined via identity-by-descent, which cannot be observed directly. It is useful to consider how the understanding gained here can be leveraged to improve our ability to identify standing sweeps. To do this we turn to the ordered haplotype frequency spectrum.


%One possible approach is to modify the prior in recently developed algorithms for sampling from the ancestral recombination graph \citep[e.g. ARGweaver,][]{Rasmussen:2014gj} to approximate the genealogical distortions expected under different sweep scenarios. This approach seems likely to be fruitful, but lies beyond the scope of this paper.

%An alternate possibility which seems potentially fruitful is to identify a set of summary statistics which can jointly distinguish swept regions from non-swept regions, as well as distinguish among different kinds of sweeps. 

For a window of size $L$, we define the the ordered haplotype frequency spectrum (OHFS) as $\mathcal{H}_L = \{h_1,h_2,\dots,h_{H}\}$, where $h_p$ gives the sample frequency of the $p^{th}$ most common haplotype and there are a total of $H$ distinct haplotypes within the window. Coarse summaries of the OHFS have been a popular vehicle for sweep-finding methods \cite[e.g. EHH, iHS and H12:][]{Sabeti:2002ge,Voight:2006go,Garud:2015jy}. We focus on identifying which aspects of the OHFS should be most informative about the size, as well as the shape of the genealogy at the focal site.

Specifically, we conducted coalescent simulations with a sample size of $n=100$ chromosomes under four different models of sequence evolution (hard sweeps, standing sweeps from $f=0.05$, soft sweeps conditional on three origins of the beneficial mutation, and neutral), with all sweep simulations set to $s=0.01$. 

One simple prediction on the basis of our analytical investigation above is that, because the genealogy under a standing sweep is generally larger than that under a hard sweep, recombination events out of the sweep should accumulate more quickly along the sequence and therefore the total number of haplotypes in a window of a given size should be larger for a standing sweep than for a hard sweep. To study this we denote by $H_L$ the number of distinct haplotypes in a window of size $L$, and study properties of $H_L$ and $\mathcal{H}_L$ over simulations.  In \jb{figure BLAH} we show from simulations $P\left(H_L^{stand} \geq i \right)/P\left(H_L^{hard} \geq i \right)$ for $n = 100$ over a range of $L$ for one sided windows extending away from the selected site. As expected, we see that the number of haplotypes increases more quickly with distance from the selected site for a standing sweep than for a hard sweep. Unfortunately, as we alluded to above \jb{ref to statement about higher f small s relation}, this signal is largely confounded by the fact that one can also obtain a similarly rapid increase in the number of haplotypes from a hard sweep with a slightly weaker selection coefficient \jb{panel B of figure BLAH}.

Alternately, we may hope to use to OHFS to obtain information about the shape of the genealogy at the focal site, which should hopefully be less confounded by a change in selection coefficient. This information should primarily be found in differences in the relative frequencies of certain haplotypes between the different models, rather than in the total number of haplotypes. Specifically, that if there are multiple haplotypes present close to the selection site,  they should be more common under the sweeps from standing variation model than the full sweep model. In other words, there should be a window near the selected site where $\mathbb{E}[h_i^{stand} \mid h_i^{stand} > 0] > \mathbb{E}[h_i^{hard} \mid h_i^{hard} > 0]$ for $1 < i \ll n$, owing to recombinations occurring on internal branches of the genealogy from the standing phase. 

In \jb{figure BLAH}, we show $\mathbb{E}[h_i^{M1} \mid h_i^{M1} > 0]/\mathbb{E}[h_i^{M2} \mid h_i^{M2} > 0]$ where $M1$ and $M2$ denote different models of sequence evolution (i.e. standing, hard, or soft sweep or neutral). In particular, we wish to draw attention to the fact that, similar to the multiple mutation model, most of the useful information within the OHFS for distinguishing standing sweeps from hard sweeps lies within a small window near the selected site, and comes in the form of a decrease in the relative frequency of the core haplotype, and corresponding overabundance of the next few most common haplotypes. Unfortunately, standing sweeps do not result in as strong of an enrichment for these next few haplotypes as under the multiple mutation case, although for large samples the enrichment persists for a sizable chunk of the OHFS. We also observe that, contrary to multiple mutation soft sweep model, far away from the selected site, standing sweeps resemble hard sweeps across the majority of the OHFS. This is in line with expectations from our analytical theory above, in that close to the selected site the haplotype partition is dominated by events occurring during the standing phase, while far from the selected site it is dominated by events occurring during the sweep phase.

On the basis of these simulation results, we suspect that future methods for identifying and distinguishing different varieties of sweeps will see benefits from incorporating haplotypic information over a range of window sizes surrounding the focal site, and from pushing deeper into the haplotype frequency spectrum, particularly when large samples are available.

\section{Discussion}

An accurate portrait of the patterns of sequence diversity expected in the presence of recent or ongoing positive selection has proven to be vital for identifying the adaptive loci. Recent theoretical and empirical work has drawn attention to the fact that adaptation from standing variation may be relatively common, and that patterns of sequence variation produced in such scenarios may differ markedly from those produced under the classical hard sweep model. In this paper, we've focused on developing a tractable model of strong positive selection on a single mutation which was previously segregating (or balanced) at low frequency. We have shown that many aspects of the pre-sweep standing phase of the mutation's history on post-hitchhiking patterns variation can be approximated via an application of the Ewens Sampling Formula. This provides a way to build intution for the process and obtain various analytical approximations for patterns of variation following a sweep from standing variation. 

Our results can be understood within the context of a number of recent approximations for different sweep phenomena, which divide the sweep into distinct phases \jb{cite BARTON?}. Because rates of coalescence and recombination vary across these phases, different sections of the sequence surrounding a sweep will convey information about different phases, with sites distant from the selected locus generally conveying information about the late stages of the sweep, and sites close to the selected locus conveying information about the early stages of the sweep. In our model, the late phase corresponds largely to what we've called the sweep phase, while the early phase corresponds to our standing phase. In general, the major differences between different sweep phenomena occur during the earliest phases, and thus the information to distinguish them is found near to the selected site, while extra information about the strength of the sweep can be found at sites that are more distant.

For the intermediate/late phase of the sweep, we apply the standard approximation which prohibits coalescence during this phase, only allowing lineages to recombine as singletons. However, even for relatively strong selection (e.g. $2Ns = 1000$) and small sample sizes ($n = 10$), this approximation is inadequate, as the probability of at least one (and sometimes multiple) coalescent events during this phase is actually relatively high. As a result, our approximation for the frequency spectrum following a sweep breaks down somewhat despite its accuracy in describing the frequency spectrum immediately before the onset of the sweep phase. This could be remedied by including more advanced approximations to coalescence during the sweep phase, however, the expressions are already somewhat cumbersome. 

\gc{POINT ABOUT recessive sweeps?}

Unfortunately, our work likely confirms the intuition and existing results \gc{REFs} indicating that standing sweeps are likely to be rather difficult to identify, and characterize, on the basis of genetic data from a single population time-point, and when they can be identified, they will be difficult to distinguish from classic hard sweeps \cite{Peter:2012ht}. This can be understood from first principles by recognizing that the identification of a standing sweep amounts to recognizing that a particular region of the genome has experienced a reduction in effective population size by a factor $f$. This task is made difficult by three factors. The first is that the size of this region over which this reduction persists is small enough that one only gets a single sample from the rescaled coalescent with which to identify this reduction in population size. The second is that because the region over which this shrunken genealogy persists is so short, relatively few new mutations occur on this genealogy, and thus there is a dearth of information about its structure. As a result, most of the information about the structure and size of the genealogy will therefore come from ancestral mutations which recombine into it via a process described by our Ewens approximation. Finally, the size of the region over which this signal can be perceived at all is inversely proportional to the strength of selection during the sweep phase, and thus the signature of a standing sweep will generally only be visible when the product of the selection coefficient and the frequency from which the sweep starts is sufficiently large. Because we do not know any of these quantities in advance, any method which seeks to identify standing sweeps and distinguish them from other varieties of sweeps must \gc{something something something.}

A more hopefully approach to selection on standing variation is to use data from closely related populations where the allele has not been favored (or has failed to spread) or ancient DNA. We should expect the selected site, and those tightly linked to it, to show high differentiation between populations  \citep{Innan_and_Kim2 }. If we have good evidence that the allele has spread rapidly, e.g. if the populations are very closely related, then evidence that it is a sweep from standing variation could be gained from demostrating that the genomic width of the sweep was much smaller than expected given how quickly it would have to have transited through the population.
