\section{Results}
\jb{thinking perhaps we should motivate our whole framework with a fair bit of verbal description before we delve into any math. Ideas here are reletively straightforward, but a fair bit of ``scene setting'' to do first}

The key insight for this paper is that the recombination events that occur during the period when an allele is neutral or balanced prior to a sweep can be treated like mutations, and thus under the assumption of constant population size, we can use the Ewens Sampling Formula to calculate expectations for a variety of quantities of interest in the region surrounding the selected site.

Consider a neutral locus partially linked (with recombination rate $r$) to a second locus where an allele arises, and is initially either neutral, or balanced at a low frequency, but eventually becomes beneficial (due to a change in environment). Let's say we take a sample of two lineages the moment the sweep fixes and want to make some meaningful statements about its genealogy. We separate the history of the locus into two different regimes; the first being time period during which the sweep is occurring, and the second being the period prior to which the allele became beneficial, during which it was either balanced or neutral at a constant frequency $f$. We imagine that the mutation occurs far enough in the past that neutral processes occurring on the background of the allele are not strongly influence by the existence of the mutations (i.e. the mutation doesn't force coalescence during the pre-sweep phase). We also make a simplifying assumption that only recombination (but no coalescence or mutation) can occur during the course of the sweep. For our purposes it will serve simply to track whether both lineages fail to recombine off of the selected background or not. If we let $X\left(t\right)$ be the frequency of the selected allele at time $t$ in the past, the probability that a single lineage fails to recombine off in a given generation is $e^{-r\left(1-X(t)\right)}$. The probability that a single lineage manages to recombine off the selected background at any point during the course of the sweep is given by $e^{-r \int_f^{1}(1-X\left(t\right))\mathrm{d}t}$. For now I will simply set $\mathcal{T}_f = \int_f^{1}(1-X\left(t\right))\mathrm{d}t$, so that the probability that a lineage manages to recombine off the selected background during the course of the sweep is $e^{-r\mathcal{T}_f}$. In our sample of two, because we assume that the sweep occurs fast enough that the probability of coalescence during the sweep is essentially zero, the two lineages recombine out of the selected phase independently, and thus the probability that both lineages fail to recombine off during the sweep is $e^{-2r\mathcal{T}_f}$.

Now let's consider the second phase, in which the (soon to be) beneficial allele is either balanced or neutral. We make the simplifying assumption that if the frequency of the allele was $f$ when the sweep began, then it is held constant at $f$ for the time period that is relevant to the processes we are interested in. The relevant case to consider is that in which both lineages have failed to recombine during the course of the sweep and therefore both enter the neutral phase. Because the two alleles exist within a small subpopulation with size $2Nf$, they coalesce at rate $\frac{1}{2Nf}$. Each lineage at the neutral locus recombines off the background of the (future) selected allele at a rate $r(1-f)$. Therefore, the probability that the two lineages coalesce before either of them manages to recombine off the background is given by
$$\frac{\frac{1}{2Nf}}{\frac{1}{2Nf} + r(1-f)} = \frac{1}{1 + 4Nrf(1-f)}$$
